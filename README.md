# Hi there, I'm Radomir! üëã

I'm a **Python Developer and Machine Learning Enthusiast** with a deep passion for **extracting meaningful insights from complex celestial data**. I primarily work with **Python, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, numpy, pandas and specialized libraries like Astropy** and love turning **raw observational data into predictive models of the cosmos**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools

I primarily work with the following languages, frameworks, and tools:

### Language ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)
### AI/ML & Scientific Frameworks:
![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white)
![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-F7931E?style=flat-square&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)
![Keras](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Keras-D00000?style=flat&logo=keras&logoColor=white)

## Libraries

![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-333333?style=flat&logo=pandas)
![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-000000?style=flat&logo=python)

### üöÄ Commitment to AI/ML Excellence
My long-term career ambition is to excel in the field of scientific AI. To that end, I am proactively strengthening my theoretical foundation in **mathematics and physics**. I am currently working through **Linear Algebra** to better grasp the mechanics of neural networks and gradient descent.

This self-driven study is a key part of my commitment to become a developer who doesn't just write code, but who can **design and optimize novel AI solutions for complex astronomical challenges**. I am eager to contribute to a role where this theoretical knowledge can be put into practice.

## üöÄ Featured Project: **Galaxy Zoo Classifier**

A **'what my project does'** designed to **'what it does'**.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` / `TensorFlow` / `NumPy` / `Pandas` /  `Scikit-learn` /  `Matplotlib`
