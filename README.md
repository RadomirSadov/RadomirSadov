# Hi there, I'm Radomir! üëã

I'm a **Python Developer and Machine Learning Enthusiast** with a deep passion for **extracting meaningful insights from complex celestial data**. I primarily work with **Python, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, numpy, pandas and specialized libraries like Astropy** and love turning **raw observational data into predictive models of the cosmos**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools

I primarily work with the following languages, frameworks, and tools:

### üìö Commitment to AI/ML Excellence
My long-term career ambition is to excel in the field of scientific AI. To that end, I am proactively strengthening my theoretical foundation in **mathematics and physics**. I am currently working through **Linear Algebra** to better grasp the mechanics of neural networks and gradient descent.

This self-driven study is a key part of my commitment to become a developer who doesn't just write code, but who can **design and optimize novel AI solutions for complex astronomical challenges**. I am eager to contribute to a role where this theoretical knowledge can be put into practice.

üöÄ Featured Project: Deep-Space Galaxy Classifier (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed to automatically classify galaxy images based on their visual morphology, directly addressing the massive data volume of modern astronomical surveys.

This project replicates the core task of the citizen science initiative Galaxy Zoo using deep learning to achieve scalable, accurate classification.

Project Highlights:Objective:

To classify galaxies into a binary (2-class) or multi-class system (based on the Binary_2_5_dataset.h5 file) by identifying structural features like spiral arms or smooth, elliptical shapes.

Model Architecture: 

Implements a custom sequential CNN architecture featuring Convolutional Layers (Conv2D) and Max-Pooling for robust feature extraction, culminating in a Global Average Pooling layer to reduce dimensionality and a Softmax output for class probability prediction.

Preprocessing Pipeline:

Includes necessary steps for production-ready model training:

Data Normalization ($\frac{x}{255}$) for stable training.
Image Resizing to a standard $224 \times 224$ input using $\texttt{tf.image.resize}$.
Label One-Hot Encoding using $\texttt{to\_categorical}$.
Data Augmentation (random flips, brightness, and contrast adjustments) to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Training & Evaluation: 

Utilizes advanced Keras callbacks, including ModelCheckpoint (for saving the best model), EarlyStopping (for efficiency), and ReduceLROnPlateau (for optimizing learning rate). 

Final performance is comprehensively assessed using Validation Loss/Accuracy, a Confusion Matrix, and a full Classification Report.

## There are going to be changes to the project. It's not fully done... ###
